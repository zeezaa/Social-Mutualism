My opinion on "Taxation is theft":
It is not, you're paying for essential services everyone including you in the country uses.
I do wish for a system where if you don't pay taxes you lose access to public services and/or have to pay out of pocket.
There could also be a system to allocate where part of your taxes go, as not to fund programs you don't agree with.
