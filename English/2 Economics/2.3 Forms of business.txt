We should encourage new companies to look into starting cooperatives instead of corporations and encourage existing corporations to convert into co-ops or run their business more democratically.
These cooperatives shall have a misappropriation and mismanagement reporting system where the local judge or governing body shall rule on the matter.
Other types of companies shall not be given benefits from the state unless their workers believe the company is run democratically and workers opinions are being listened to.
