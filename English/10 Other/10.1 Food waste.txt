To minimize food waste we should encourage food producers to discount or give away any food that would otherwise go to waste.
Schools and other public institutions should give away food to take home and/or sell it to non-members at a low cost.
Restaurants should give workers the opportunity to take home food that would otherwise go to waste and/or sell it to customers at a discount.
Grocery stores should also discount food waste with a discount basket or membership discounts.
An extra example is to give the food waste to charities sharing food and giving to people who need it the most.
