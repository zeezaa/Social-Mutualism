Social Mutualism
"Expand democracy even in the workplace!"

Social Mutualism is a leftist libertarian ideology advocating government transparency, reduced regulations, and simplified hierarchies.
It emphasizes local decision-making, decentralization and direct democracy.

The aim of Social Mutualism is to achieve socialism through workplace reforms, participatory democracy, and increased personal freedoms.
"Give everyone shelter, food, healthcare and education, if you want more/better you work."
Universal Basic Income (UBI) would be great, serving as a foundational safety net.

Workplaces should operate with workplace democracy, empowering workers to actively participate in business matters and decision-making processes.

Social Mutualism draws inspiration from Mutualism, Market Socialism, Pirate Politics, Experimentalism, Gradualism,
Participatory democracy, Welfarism, Labor rights, Libertarian Socialism, and Vikiism.
