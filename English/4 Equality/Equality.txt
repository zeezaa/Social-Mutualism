Social Mutualists believe in radical equality where everyone is treated fairly when it comes to:
gender, age, origin, citizenship, language, religion, belief, opinion, political activity, trade union activity,
family relationships, health condition, disability, sexual orientation or other reason related to the person.
The state...
- Must operate so that it respects all biological genders and the diversity of gender identity.
- Does not need to know an individual's gender and thusly it should be removed from citizens IDs.
- Must either make army conscription optional or make conscription mandatory to everyone regardless of their gender.
- Give parental leave equally to both/all parental guardians.
- Must not give preferential treatment to certain religions.
