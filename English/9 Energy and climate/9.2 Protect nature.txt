Social Mutualism agrees with the demands of Extinction Rebellion:
- Governments must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.
- Governments must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.
- Governments must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizensâ€™ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.
