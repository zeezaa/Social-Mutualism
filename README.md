Social Mutualism is a leftist libertarian ideology that advocates for:
- More government transparency, (less government regulation) and simplifying hierarchical structures.
- More local decision-making and decentralization with more direct democracy. (state laws)
- Socialist goals can be achieved via workplace reforms, participatory democracy and more freedoms from the state.
- Give everyone shelter, food, healthcare and education, if you want more/better you work. UBI 'nuf said.
- Let workers vote on business matters via workplace democracy.
